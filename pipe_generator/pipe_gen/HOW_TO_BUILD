Hi future Jordan,

Because you almost certainly forgot how to package this code into a single
executable using pyinstaller, here is the command:

    pyinstaller pipe_gen.py --add-data template.world:./ -F

Or if you haven't changed the resource files you need, you can probably do something like this:
    pyinstaller pipe_gen.py pipe_gen.spec

Remember to use this resource_path trick on any resources when you access them in the code:

    def resource_path(relative_path):
        """ Get absolute path to resource, works for dev and for PyInstaller """
        try:
            # PyInstaller creates a temp folder and stores path in _MEIPASS
            base_path = sys._MEIPASS
        except Exception:
            base_path = os.path.abspath(".")

        return os.path.join(base_path, relative_path)
